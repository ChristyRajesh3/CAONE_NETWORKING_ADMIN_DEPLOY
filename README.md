**Setup and Installation**

**1.Clone the Repository:**

        git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git] 
        (https://github.com/ChristyRajesh3/CAONE_NETWORKING_ADMIN_DEPLOY.git)
        
        cd CAONE_NETWORKING_ADMIN_DEPLOY

**2.Install Dependencies:**

        Ensure all prerequisites are installed and configured.

**3.Set Up Azure Credentials:**

        Authenticate with Azure using the Azure CLI:
                          az login   #Log into azure through commandline

**4.Initialize Terraform:**
                                      
        cd terraform        #open current directory to terraform.
        terraform init      #initialise terraform.
        
**5.Configure Ansible:**

    Update the playbook.yml file as needed for your deployment.

**Configuration:**

     Terraform Variables: 
                         Update terraform/main.tf with your Azure subscription details and other configurations.

     Ansible Playbook: 
                      Modify playbook.yml to include your deployment tasks.

     Docker Configuration: 
                          Update hello-world-app/Dockerfile and any related files for your application.


**Usage:**

**1. Provision Infrastructure:**
                              Use Terraform to provision Azure resources:

                              cd terraform  
                              terraform plan
                              terraform apply  

**2. Deploy Containers:**

                              ansible-playbook playbook.yml

**3. Trigger CI/CD Pipeline:**

                              Push changes to the main branch to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow defined in   .github/workflows/deploy.yml.

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**

                            The GitHub Actions workflow automates the build, test, and deployment process. The workflow is defined in .github/workflows/deploy.yml. Key steps include:

                                                          1.Building Docker images.

                                                          3.Deploying to Azure.
**Terraform Infrastructure as Code:**

                                    Terraform is used to define and provision Azure resources. The configuration is located in terraform/main.tf.


**Ansible Playbooks:**

                      Ansible playbooks are used for configuration management and deployment. The main playbook is playbook.yml.


**Docker Integration:**

                      Docker is used to containerize the application. The Dockerfile is located in hello-world-app/Dockerfile.

**Azure Cloud Integration:**
                      
                      Azure is used as the cloud provider. Key services include:
